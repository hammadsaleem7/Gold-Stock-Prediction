# Gold Stock Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`12_Class.ipynb`) that demonstrates the process of predicting gold stock prices using machine learning techniques. The project is designed to help users understand how to analyze financial data, preprocess it, and build predictive models for stock price forecasting.

## Overview

The notebook covers the following key steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathering historical gold stock price data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends, patterns, and correlations in the data.
4. **Model Selection**: Choosing appropriate machine learning models for stock price prediction.
5. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training the selected models and evaluating their performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or R-squared.
6. **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict future gold stock prices.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` or `pytorch` (if deep learning models are used)
- `yfinance` or another data source for stock price data

You can install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn yfinance
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hammadsaleem7/Gold-Stock-Prediction.git
   cd Gold-Stock-Prediction
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook 12_Class.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and see the results.

## Results

The notebook provides insights into the performance of different machine learning models for gold stock price prediction. Key findings include:
- Comparison of model accuracy.
- Visualization of predicted vs. actual stock prices.
- Discussion of the limitations and potential improvements.
